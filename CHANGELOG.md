# Changelog

All notable changes to `overleaf-mcp-rt`. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The "public API" for versioning purposes is the MCP tool surface (names, arguments, result shapes, error codes), the CLI, and the credentials file format.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Project lifecycle tools.** Agents can now create blank/example projects, clone and rename projects, archive/unarchive, trash/restore, and permanently delete projects through the same authenticated Overleaf session: `overleaf_create_project`, `overleaf_clone_project`, `overleaf_rename_project`, `overleaf_archive_project`, `overleaf_unarchive_project`, `overleaf_trash_project`, `overleaf_untrash_project`, and `overleaf_delete_project`.


## [2.2.0] — 2026-09-20

Projects that Overleaf has moved to its newer document format (history-OT) no longer fail to open: they can be read, and edited if you opt in. Nothing changes for classic projects — which today is every project most people have.

### Added

- **Projects on Overleaf's newer document format (history-OT) can be read, and — opt-in — edited.** Overleaf is migrating projects (`otMigrationStage` > 0) from the ShareJS text type to the operation format of its history system; until now such a project's documents could not be opened at all ("client does not support history-ot"). The engine now detects the format per document, declares support when joining, converts edits to and from text operations at the socket, and predicts the server's handling of an in-flight edit with a port of Overleaf's own algorithm for that format — so live co-editing, `<external-changes>`, write guards and everything else behave as on classic projects. **Writes to such documents are off by default** (`HISTORY_OT_WRITES_DISABLED`, nothing sent; enable with `OVERLEAF_HISTORY_OT_WRITES=1`): a write the server rejects disconnects everyone in the document, and the format could only be verified against Community Edition, not overleaf.com. The first write to each such document is checked against a fresh server snapshot; a difference raises `HISTORY_OT_MISMATCH` and stops further writes for the session. `overleaf_add_comment` refuses on such documents (`COMMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`, before creating a thread): anchoring uses a different operation that could not be verified. Verified live against Community Edition 6.0.1 and 6.3.0 with a project switched to the format; no migrated project on overleaf.com was available to test against.

### Fixed

- Nothing user-visible, but worth recording: the randomized co-editing test that guards the core "never desync a human" fix used a one-line LCG whose low bits are stuck at zero in JavaScript, so it generated almost no collaborator edits. It now uses a proper PRNG and asserts that its scenario really contains races; the engine passes unchanged. The same check caught that the classic and history-OT transforms disagree on some overlaps, which is why history-OT got its own.

### Testing

- The live suite runs every scenario against both protocols on releases that have history-OT (the matrix switches a project in the throw-away instance's Mongo), and gained a scenario where two clients fire overlapping replacements at the same version and must converge.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09-20

Installable in Codex, verified against real servers, and five bugs fewer. The new live test suite runs the built server against throw-away Overleaf Community Edition instances (4.2, 5.5, 6.0, 6.3) and against overleaf.com; everything under *Fixed* below marked as found by it was invisible to the unit tests.

### Added

- **Codex plugin.** `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` makes the repository installable with `codex plugin marketplace add DanielHou315/overleaf-mcp-rt` + `codex plugin add overleaf-mcp-rt@overleaf-mcp-rt`: the MCP server, the four skills, and the two commands (which Codex turns into skills). Codex could already install from the Claude Code manifest, but it does not expand the plugin-root variable in MCP arguments, so the server silently never started.

### Changed

- **Supported Community Edition range is now 4.x – 6.x** (was declared as 3.x – 6.x). The new version matrix showed that 3.x never worked: its real-time service predates the join-on-connect handshake this client uses, so the connection never completes (tested with 3.5.13). 4.2, 5.5, 6.0 and 6.3 pass the full live suite.

### Fixed

Found by the new live test suite running against real Overleaf servers:

- **A tool call could hang for a minute when the real-time connection never completes** (a reverse proxy that doesn't forward `/socket.io`, or an unsupported Overleaf 3.x). The project handshake now times out after 20 s with a `NETWORK_ERROR` that says what to check; reconnect attempts are bounded the same way.
- **Writing an emoji could later get everyone disconnected from the doc.** Overleaf cannot store characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane: its document-updater rewrites every UTF-16 surrogate in inserted text to U+FFFD, and only acknowledges the sender without telling it. The engine kept the original characters in its snapshot, so its next delete across that text did not match the server's and was rejected — and Overleaf answers a rejected op by disconnecting every client on the doc. The engine now applies the same rewrite before sending, so both sides always agree, and `overleaf_edit_doc` / `overleaf_write_doc` add a `notes` entry telling the agent which characters could not be stored.
- **`overleaf_read_compile_log` / `overleaf_download_pdf` right after `overleaf_compile` failed with "No log produced".** Overleaf allows one compile per project per second and answers a second one with `too-recently-compiled` and no output files. Compiles now wait out that window once and retry; they are also no longer flagged as editor auto-compiles (`auto_compile=true`), which the server throttles per user and server-wide; and the error names the compile status when there really is no log.
- **`overleaf_read_compile_log` and `overleaf_download_pdf` returned 404 on overleaf.com.** A build's output only exists on the compile server that produced it; downloads now carry the `clsiserverid` and `compileGroup` from the compile response, as the editor does. Output served from a separate download domain is fetched without the session cookie or proxy headers, which belong to the Overleaf origin only.

Also:

- `diagnose` no longer prints `⚠ reverse-proxy — CF detected but no extra headers configured` for an instance that merely sits behind a CDN and works. A proxy is now only mentioned when it is actually in the way: a redirect to a sign-in page on another host, or a 401 / 403 / challenge on `/project`, is reported as `PROXY_AUTH_FAILED` (previously a generic error or a misleading `OVERLEAF_AUTH_FAILED`) with a hint about `login --header` / `OVERLEAF_EXTRA_HEADERS`; and an OT handshake that fails after REST succeeded points at WebSocket forwarding.

### Documentation

- README leads with support for both self-hosted Overleaf (Community Edition / Server Pro) and overleaf.com, with a new *Supported Overleaf servers* table and a short recording of an agent and a person editing the same file.

### Testing

- **Live test suite and Community Edition version matrix** (`test/live/`). `run-matrix.sh` starts a throw-away Overleaf CE for each supported release line (4.2, 5.5, 6.0, 6.3), runs the built server against it over stdio — tools, string edits with non-ASCII text, an agent editing while a second client types in the same line, write guards, uploads, compile, comments — checks the server's own logs for OT errors, and removes every container, volume, network and pulled image. The instances publish no ports and live on an internal Docker network. The same suite runs against a configured host (`LIVE_HOST=overleaf.com npm run test:live`). Replaces the old `test/integration` scaffold, which published a port and needed a hand-made account.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-09-20

First release since 1.1.1. (1.2.0 was prepared but never published; its changes are included here.) A major version because agent-visible behaviour changed in ways that can break existing prompts and integrations — see the next section.

The theme: the server is now safe to use **while a human edits the same document in the browser**, it works against **overleaf.com** as well as self-hosted instances, and editing works the way coding agents edit files.

### Breaking changes — migrating from 1.x

- **`overleaf_write_doc` can now refuse.** It returns `DOC_NOT_READ` for a non-empty doc the agent hasn't read this session and `DOC_CHANGED_EXTERNALLY` if a collaborator edited it since. *Migrate:* read first, or switch to `overleaf_edit_doc`; pass `overwrite: true` to get the 1.x behaviour.
- **Multi-edit calls are sequential.** Edits in one `overleaf_edit_doc` call now apply in order, each to the result of the previous; in 1.x they all resolved against the original text. *Migrate:* an `old_string`/`find` must match the text as it stands after the earlier edits in the same call.
- **`overleaf_edit_doc` advertises a new schema** — `{old_string, new_string, replace_all?}`. The 1.x `mode`-based edits are still accepted at runtime, but clients that validate arguments against the published schema must move to the new shape. `replace_lines` and `raw_ops` are refused with `DOC_CHANGED_EXTERNALLY` if the doc changed since the agent last saw it.
- **Tool results may carry a second text block**, `<external-changes>…</external-changes>`, after the JSON. *Migrate:* parse the first content block as JSON rather than concatenating all blocks.
- **`OT_VERSION_DRIFT` is never emitted**, and new error codes exist (`EDIT_NO_MATCH`, `EDIT_AMBIGUOUS`, `DOC_CHANGED_EXTERNALLY`, `DOC_NOT_READ`, `COMMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`). "Anchor not found / ambiguous" used to be `OVERLEAF_GENERIC`.
- **The server no longer exits on a bad or expired session.** It starts and reports `OVERLEAF_AUTH_FAILED` per tool call. Supervisors that relied on the exit code to detect auth failure should call a tool (or `diagnose`) instead.
- **Credentials file v2.** `~/.config/overleaf-mcp-rt/credentials.json` is rewritten as `{default, hosts}` by the next `login`. 2.x reads the 1.x file; **1.x cannot read the 2.x file**, so don't mix versions against one config directory (`OVERLEAF_CREDENTIALS_FILE` can separate them).
- **No project-level `.mcp.json` in the repository** — the repo root is now a plugin. If you ran the server from a checkout via that file, install the plugin from the checkout instead (README → Developing).

### Fixed

- **Agent edits knocking browser sessions "out of sync".** The OT engine ignored collaborators' `otUpdateApplied` broadcasts, so once a human typed, the agent's next op was computed against stale text and submitted at a stale version. document-updater rejected it (`Delete component … does not match`), and Overleaf's real-time service answers a rejected op by sending `otUpdateError` to — and disconnecting — *every* client in the doc, discarding the human's unsaved keystrokes. The engine now applies every remote op to a live snapshot, transforms its own in-flight op past ops that beat it to the server (a port of the ShareJS `text` type document-updater itself runs, so both sides compute the same text), and evaluates edits against the live text in the same tick the op is emitted.
- **Write confirmation.** The `applyOtUpdate` ack only means the op was queued. The engine now waits for the real confirmation (`otUpdateApplied {doc, v}`) and surfaces `otUpdateError` rejections, which were previously invisible.
- **Parallel reads.** real-time fails a `joinDoc` that another join overtakes; joins are now serialized, time out instead of wedging the queue, and updates that arrive before a join's response are replayed onto the snapshot.
- **The server starts even when the session has expired.** Auth is checked on the first tool call and reported as `OVERLEAF_AUTH_FAILED` with a hint, instead of the process exiting before the MCP handshake (which hosts show as an unexplained "connection closed"). Logging in again fixes a running server without a restart.
- The version reported in the MCP handshake and `--help` was hard-coded (`1.0.0`); it now comes from `package.json`.

### Added

- **`overleaf_edit_doc` by exact string replacement** — `{old_string, new_string, replace_all?}`: `old_string` must match exactly one place, edits apply sequentially and atomically, a whitespace/indentation/re-wrap-tolerant fallback is accepted when unambiguous, the op sent is the minimal character diff (collaborators' cursors elsewhere are undisturbed), and the result includes a unified diff. Failures report the closest matching region.
- **External-change awareness** — every tool result (success or error) carries an `<external-changes>` block — diff, author, age, plus file-tree events — when collaborators changed something the agent has already seen. Reported once; the agent's own edits never are. New tool `overleaf_check_changes` for polling.
- **Multiple hosts** — one server can be logged in to several Overleaf instances. Every tool takes an optional `host`; new tool `overleaf_list_hosts`; new `hosts` CLI command; `--host` for `ls` and `diagnose`. Credentials file v2 (`{default, hosts}`); the v1 file is still read and is upgraded by the next `login`.
- **overleaf.com support** for projects on the classic OT pipeline, verified against production. The server fetches the load-balancer stickiness cookie (`GCLB`) so the Socket.IO handshake and websocket reach the same backend.
- **Browser login** — `login --browser` launches an installed Chromium-family browser with a throwaway profile, lets you sign in normally (CAPTCHA, SSO, 2FA), and captures the session over the DevTools protocol. No prompts when `--url` and `--browser` are both given. `OVERLEAF_BROWSER` picks the binary.
- **Friendlier cookie login** — accepts a bare value or `name=value` and detects `overleaf_session2` / `overleaf.sid` / `sharelatex.sid`.
- **Review-panel comments** (overleaf.com and Server Pro) — `overleaf_list_comments`, `overleaf_add_comment`, `overleaf_reply_comment`, `overleaf_resolve_comment`. Comments are posted through the logged-in account, so every agent comment ends with `Co-authored by <agent name>`; the server enforces this (`agentName` is required), with `omitSignature` for when the user explicitly opts out. Stock Community Edition has no review panel: these tools fail up front with `COMMENTS_UNSUPPORTED` and change nothing.
- **The repository is an installable agent plugin** for Claude Code, Cursor and Codex: dual manifests (`.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`), shared `skills/` and `commands/`, and the MCP server wired in. Four concise, model-neutral skills (`overleaf-setup`, `overleaf-editing`, `overleaf-latex-workflow`, `overleaf-comments`) and two commands (`/overleaf-login`, `/overleaf-status`). `overleaf-mcp-rt skills install [--target <dir>]` copies the skills for any other harness.
- MCP server `instructions`, giving every connecting agent the collaboration and signature rules.
- `overleaf_read_doc` returns the doc `version`. `--version` flag. CI and tag-driven release workflows; `scripts/release-prep.mjs` sets the version everywhere in one step. `OVERLEAF_CREDENTIALS_FILE` relocates the credentials file.
- New error codes: `EDIT_NO_MATCH`, `EDIT_AMBIGUOUS`, `DOC_CHANGED_EXTERNALLY`, `DOC_NOT_READ`, `COMMENTS_UNSUPPORTED`.
- **Overleaf CE 6.x is supported** and is now the primary target (3.x – 6.x declared).
- Live-testing helpers: `scripts/agent-session.mjs`, `scripts/latency-probe.mjs`, `scripts/smoke-stdio.mjs`.

### Changed

- `overleaf_write_doc` sends only the differing characters instead of replacing the whole doc.
- `unified_diff` edits no longer send "delete everything, insert everything".
- (See *Breaking changes* above for the behavioural changes to `overleaf_write_doc` and `overleaf_edit_doc`.)

### Known limitations

- overleaf.com projects migrated to Overleaf's **history-OT** format (`otMigrationStage` > 0) cannot be read or edited yet; `joinDoc` is refused cleanly by the server. REST-backed tools still work.
- Comments are unavailable on stock Community Edition (the thread API ships only in Server Pro).

## [1.1.1]

- Bundle the CLI and vendor the patched `socket.io-client`, so `npx overleaf-mcp-rt` works without a postinstall patch step.
- Apply the `socket.io-client` patch correctly under hoisted `node_modules`.

## [1.1.0]

Agent-ergonomics release.

- **All tools renamed `overleaf_*`** so names stay unambiguous in MCP hosts that don't namespace by server.
- **`overleaf_edit_doc`** — anchor-based `replace`, `insert_before` / `insert_after`, `replace_lines`, `unified_diff`, and `raw_ops`; atomic; `dryRun`.
- **`overleaf_read_doc_range`**, **`overleaf_read_file as=base64`**, and edit summaries on write tools.
- **Structured error envelope** `{code, message, context, retryable, hint?}` (wire-format change: errors are JSON, not `code: message` text). New codes `OT_DELETE_MISMATCH`, `OT_VERSION_DRIFT`.
- **Removed `apply_patch`** — use `overleaf_edit_doc` with `mode: 'raw_ops'`.

## [1.0.0]

First stable release on npm, collapsing the internal v0.1 – v0.4 milestones.

- Live OT reads and writes through Overleaf's native operational-transform pipeline (ported from Overleaf-Workshop).
- Project tree CRUD over REST; compile, compile log and PDF download.
- `login`, `ls`, `diagnose` CLI commands; reverse-proxy auth pass-through via `OVERLEAF_EXTRA_HEADERS`.
- Per-doc write serialization, reconnect with jitter, subpath-safe URL handling.
- AGPL-3.0-or-later.
